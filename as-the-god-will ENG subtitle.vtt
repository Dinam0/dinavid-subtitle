57
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.890
that game is pretty boring

58
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.240
if you are gonna do it, do it over there

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.550

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.570

70
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:34.980


71
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.920

205
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.550

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.260
there

207
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.060
so we shoot the bell through the hoop?

208
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.480
9 minutes and 30 seconds left

209
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.460
it's absolutely impossible!

210
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.920

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.490

I finally understand

224
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.620
everything has built up for this one moment

225
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.740

226
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.700

228
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.580
everybody take the costume off

229
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.780

230
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.350

231
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.280

233
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.550
what the fuck did you do

234
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.710
you told us all to wear the costume

235
00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.460
How could I have known

236
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.810
it was a trap

237
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.440

238
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.490

239
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.930
if there are no more rats, 

240
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.080
it will start eating people

241
00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:18.810
only 3 minutes left?

242
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.590
there's no time

243
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.690

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.330

250
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.400
shoot the hoop

251
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.840
fuck that, 

252
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.860
I don't wanna die like the basketball boy

253
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.620
we're all gonna die if this goes on much longer

254
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.860


255
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.560

Only I can hear it

266
00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.780
what the hell

267
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.040


268
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.110


269
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.540


270
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.340

if you wear the costume you will be eaten

276
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.650
but at the same time

277
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.260
you can understand what this thing is saying

278
00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:21.470

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.460
someone help me

286
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.860

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.680

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.690
more I want more scratching

291
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.480
more more

292
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.500
more I want more scratching

293
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:43.450
feels so good

294
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.720


295
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.120
good

296
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.220
now is our chance

297
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.510
wait a second

298
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.220
what if

299
00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.330
it's like daruma tumbler

300
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.230
everybody besides the one shooting will die

301
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:40.720
everybody scratched the cat's back

302
00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.820
did their duties

303
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.960
So I think everybody will survive

304
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.790
How do you know for sure?

305
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.820
well...

306
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.990
then I wanna shoot

307
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.280
who says you get to be the one

308
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.110
I will

309
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.020
at a time like this it should be ladies first

310
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.540
fuck off pig

311
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:04.680
give me

312
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.220
let go

313
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.130
hey

314
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.000
now is not the time to fight

315
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.020
you're just saying that

316
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.320
don't you want to live?

317
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.550
not gonna listen to you

318
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.110
everybody calm down

319
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.920
if we don't keep quite, that thing...

320
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:25.350
you

321
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.680
let go

322
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.070
this is the order of the president of the student committee

323
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.640
only thinking about yourself

324
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:35.950
you ought to give it to me

325
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.120
If we can't make it go back to sleep

326
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.790
no chance

327
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.400
no time for that

328
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.240
what do we do

329
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.410
what to do

330
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.430
what to do

331
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.000
ichika grab the bell

332
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.730
this way

333
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.200
can't let them escape

334
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.320
one is the bell, the other is a basketball

335
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.460
eyes?

336
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.330
it can tell if one is wearing the costume

337
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.410
it let the ball pass 

338
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.930
but caught the bell

339
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.540
so that thing acts only when it sees

340
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.400
this way it doesn't have the time to see

341
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.170
our chances are

342
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.920
50/50

343
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.900
guess which one is the bell

344
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.210
that idiot

345
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.560
fucked up our only chance

346
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.180
then the bell is...

347
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.610
real thing is right here!

348
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.590
how can this be?

349
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.780
letting it see the ball is....

350
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.560
on purpose

351
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.360
so it will think I had the bell

352
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.270
go in!

353
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.360


354
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.310
god

355
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.480
amaya

356
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.290
over

357
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.510
we did it

358
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:44.570
it's not over

359
00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.630
still too early

360
00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.500
this round the surviving names are

361
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:04.900
Takeru Amaya

362
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.740
Shun Takahata

363
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.280
Ichika Akimoto

364
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.080
great

365
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.000
everybody made it

366
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.460
the 3 mentioned above, survives

367
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.140
survives

368
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.780
what, what about others...

369
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.230
this is god's revolution

370
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.750
in the world after, power is the only law

371
00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.790
ones that survived are just

372
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.450
dead ones are false

373
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.620
I have always dreamed of a world like this

374
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.200
thank you god

375
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.719
thank you so much

376
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.050
this guy

377
00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:13.620
is fucked up

378
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.159
useless scrubs should die

379
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.980
weren't chosen by god were they

380
00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:21.980
This is what you are thinking too right?

381
00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.150
Shun Takahata

382
00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.610
I have never thought of it like that

383
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.679
no

384
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.320
we're the same species��

385
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.489
species

386
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.880
you can sense it

387
00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.350
only faced with death do you realize how real life is

388
00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.469
that's how you survived

389
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.230
you were chosen

390
00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:50.030
you're kidding, how do you know

391
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.679
nice expression

392
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:01.460
you 

393
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.210
are also waiting for a world like this

394
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.770
just like me

395
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.110
no

396
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.530
shun isn't like you at all

397
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.070
shun is more caring and more powerful

398
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.200
he's nothing like you

399
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.470
is that so

400
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.470
stop

401
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:51.510
new york, washington, moscow, sydney, mardrid, london,

402
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.970
highschools around the world

403
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.460
have experienced somewhat of a simultaneous terriost attack

404
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.450
we have little information on what's happening exactly

405
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.980
unconfirmed reports indicates youth casualties to be in the tens of milions

406
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.010
we have just received new information

407
00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.010
just moments ago, the prime minister

408
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.780
has just appointed an emergency response team

409
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.110
and put the entire nation under level 4 security code

410
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.050
may I have your attention

411
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.300
at this moment

412
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.130
unknown flying cubes have appeared around the world

413
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.770
rumors say

414
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.750
in the terriost attacks that took place in highschools around the world

415
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:58.270
the students that survived are all being held inside these cubes

416
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.780
now the police and national guards have gathered here to put together a rescue plan

417
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.990
but they still have to figure out how to even enter the cube

418
00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.140
the cube currently flying over okinawa

419
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.750
is being followed by our reporter

420
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.300


421
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:02.810
what the heck, right at the important part

422
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.780
... the national guards haven't been able to formulate a plan

423
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.520
main roads inside the city...

424
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.110
thanks mister

425
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.870
joining us right now

426
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.170
professor of human environment from tokyo university

427
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:30.410
Mr. Okura Tada

428
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.480
Mr okura

429
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.350
this series of terriost attacks and that unknown flying cube

430
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.750
have what kind of connecitons?

431
00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.930
these are no terriost attacks

432
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:49.490
alien invasion, is what we should seriously prepare for

433
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:55.450
the situation has already gone past the comprehension of us humans

434
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.260
what the hell is he talking about

435
00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.040
however...

436
00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:58.910
now

437
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:06.050
people are calling the surviving students "sons of god" on the internet

438
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.870
I can see that the fad has started to deify mortals

439
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.580
sons of god

440
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.930
takumi

441
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.900
I'm leaving your meal here

442
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.970
hey takumi

443
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.080
every once in a while, come out and let mom take a look

444
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.980
shut up

445
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:34.110
fuck off hag

446
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.870
sons of god

447
00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.590
sons of god

448
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.550
sons of god

449
00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.680
sons of god

450
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.850


451
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.950
are you ok, takahata

452
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.720
I had dream where I was being licked by a cat

453
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:18.150
the cat's tongue feels like...

454
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.050
so you're fine, long time no see

455
00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.090
takase, why are you here?

456
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.110
speaking of which, where are we?

457
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.520
I feel the same way

458
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.480
takase shouko, classmate, junior high

459
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:41.600
when I woke up I was already here

460
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.300
is it?

461
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.880
we haven't met since when?

462
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.800
since my transfer in 8th grade

463
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:57.750
about 3 years?

464
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.400
you look well

465
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.280
probably shouldn't have said that under current situation

466
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.930
takahata

467
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.030
what is happening to us

468
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.220
why is this happening to us

469
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.820
I really have no idea

470
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.980
but as long as we are safe

471
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.870
and I got to see you again

472
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.930
can you guys keep it down over there

473
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.380
I am using Hermannvon Helmholtz's energy theory

474
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:55.680
to try to analyze the current situation

475
00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.710
wha 

476
00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.120
this is Taira from a private school

477
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.420
and Taoka from a girl's high school

478
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.560
both of them are survivors of daruma tumbler 

479
00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.080
and beckoning cat, 

480
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.810
Taira

481
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.750
Taoka 
Takase

482
00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.350
Takahata

483
00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.350
therefore, The rooms are

484
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.980
assigned based on the 50 sounds of people's names

485
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.730
I reckon so

486
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.890
I am assigned to the same room as you guys

487
00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.360
proves it's not based on intelligence

488
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.580
what were you just dong? stop givnig me shit

489
00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.010
what's wrong

490
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.130
if that's the case, Akimoto and Amaya might be in the same room

491
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.520
we were from the same place, let me go look

492
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.730
damn it, locked again

493
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:17.190
anyone, anyone, anyone there

494
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.130
stop it, you're embarassing yourself

495
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.920
...appeared around the world...

496
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.870
...highschools around the world

497
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.210
many terriost attacks have taken place

498
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.500
... this is no terroist attack...

499
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000


500
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.540
nobody is coming to save us

501
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:52.370
current national guards don't have the capability to enter the cube to save us

502
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.030
then what do we do?

503
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:59.350
Need I say? just wait.

504
00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.580
for for the start of the next game 

505
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.880
you think there will be more games? 

506
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.780
instead of saying "will there be" I rather it's "hope to be"?

507
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.560
I can't wait to get rid of you dumb fucks

508
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.510
.. internet calls the surviving students

509
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.610
sons of god

510
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.480
I can see that the fad has started to deify mortals

511
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.260
sons of god

512
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.930
name suits me

513
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.770
sons of god

514
00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.720
open the door with the key

515
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:40.420
and it's over

516
00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.530
it's here

517
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.840
let's play together

518
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:16.760
Taira, let's play

519
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.040
great

520
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:19.270
what do we play

521
00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.060
talk about games

522
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.790
then we must play bird in a cage

523
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.580
after the song, you must guess who's behind you within 10 seconds

524
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:30.700
cover your eyes

525
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.930
can't cheat

526
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.020
interesting

527
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.250
then... 

528
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.790
let's begin

529
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.710

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.170
bambo cage bambo cage

531
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.730
little bird in a cage

532
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.360
when? when does it get out?

533
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.090
morning and night

534
00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.740
the crane and the turrle have slipped

535
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.350
right behind you, is whom?

536
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.760

537
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.640

538
00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.110

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.640
who wants to play?

544
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.780

545
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.010
next next

546
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.060
Taoka, let's play

547
00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.830
no, I don't want to, I don't wanna play

548
00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.220

549
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.130

550
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:42.870

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.730

554
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:53.570
I, am so anxious

555
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.080

556
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.470

560
00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.900


561
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.460


562
00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.070

let's play

572
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:04.700
I wanna play with you

573
00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.990

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.310


582
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:43.960


583
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.190
use their voices

584
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.600

589
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:27.470

592
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.220

594
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.520

595
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:48.800

596
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.610
didn't you say the time was up

597
00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:51.690
it's cuz of this thing

598
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.220
time is up

599
00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.050
I recorded it when Taoka was playing

600
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.080
time is up

601
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:12.600
I played it when the time was almost up

602
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.130
so I can fool one or more of you guys to talk

603
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.390
then through your voices

604
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.660
and your fixed position in the circle

605
00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:27.330
I know who's behind me

606
00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:29.340
alright, now die

607
00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.940
looks like you are the real idiot

608
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.070
takahata��

609
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.190

611
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.400
so lonely

612
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.030
without friends, I can't play

613
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.950
hey, hand hand

614
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.200

618
00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.330

619
00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:09.760
that guy will attack

620
00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.990

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.990

626
00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:19.590
no

627
00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:21.450
let's go

628
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.000

629
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:34.780

630
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:02.520


631
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:06.510
so lonely

632
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:15.150

633
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:17.160
good thing we made it

634
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:18.630
thanks

635
00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.520
Amaya?

636
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.400
no idea

637
00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:26.400
though we started out in the same room

638
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.340
but after he defeated the dolls, 

639
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:30.850
he took the key and left by himself

640
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.710
Shouko

641
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.530
long time no see

642
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.530
Kotaro

643
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:58.040
what is this

644
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.930
is that

645
00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:03.420
7 people inserting 7 keys at the same time

646
00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:06.680
also turn at the same time

647
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.930
how many you got

648
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.390
just 4 of us

649
00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.420
we are short one

650
00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.380
what do you mean?

651
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.780
looks like we need 7 people

652
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.730
and use 7 keys at the same time

653
00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.330
to be able to proceed

654
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.810
how many keys you got?

655
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.140
we have two

656
00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:27.980
we also have two

657
00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.630
that means we need 3 more keys and 1 more person

658
00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.060
or we can't open this door

659
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.290
let's wait a bit longer

660
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:34.570
maybe someone else will come

661
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.030
there's no time for that, how long have you been playing this

662
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.920
2 minutes left

663
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.030
we have to go find it

664
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.380
it's not possible

665
00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:49.590
only 2 minutes, aside from 1 person

666
00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:51.570
we have to collect 3 more keys

667
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.900
Amaya

668
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.620
awesome!

669
01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.500
we will survive to the next round

670
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.040
but we have one too many

671
01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.380
not a problem

672
01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.530
I am only using him as to not be attacked by the doll

673
01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.260
he's useless

674
01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:39.100
hey

675
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.500
your friend?

676
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.200
is it safe?

677
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.200
traveling with such a maniac

678
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.060
aren't we friends, takahata

679
01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.680


680
01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.840


681
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.290

698
01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.860

699
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.250

705
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.740
make way

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:40.380
please empty the streets

708
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.650
so I was asking

709
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:46.700
where and how did that video get there

710
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.140
there's no way into the cube right?

711
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.780
the press has made contact with the aliens?

712
01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.220

713
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.920

715
01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.000
where is this place?

716
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.170

717
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:47.860
that what was that

718
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.290
Hi everybody

719
01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:16.740
I love white

720
01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.250
white is my favorite color

721
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.650
what 

722
01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.460
I hate bad people

723
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:51.840
so don't lie

724
01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.600
speak the truth

725
01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:56.170
speak the truth and it's over

726
01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.930
meaning?

727
01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.360

please everybody

729
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.220
answer the questions truthfully

730
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.540
if everybody told the truth

731
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.540
the game is over

732
01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.020
but if someone is lying

733
01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.700
then someone will be sacrificed

734
01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.180
keep that in mind

735
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.250
sacrificed?

736
01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:29.540

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.280

these kinds of questions?

741
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.920
we would win so easily

742
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.020
my favourite is

01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:59.210

744
01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:00.820
I like 

745
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.260
lamien

746
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.880
meat

747
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.580
sweet potato

748
01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.660
curry

749
01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.660
egg rice

750
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.890
crepe

751
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.080
stop lying

752
01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.200

754
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.530

755
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:44.400
2 minutes

756
01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.740
2 minutes

757
01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.100
who's lying

758
01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.760

759
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.040
it's not you?

760
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.680
it's not me

761
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:04.450
I didn't lie

762
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.450
where's the proof

763
01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:07.620
what are you thinking

764
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:09.860
wanting proof...

765
01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.010
How can you prove things like this

766
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.280
what are you looking at

767
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.480

01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:22.760
just wait a second, calm down

770
01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.600
I'm very calm

771
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:28.530
the one pretending to be a good studnet is the most suspicious

772
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:31.460
I know shun likes curry

773
01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.090

774
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.090
I can eat egg rice 3 times a day no problem

775
01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.130
you must be the one lying

776
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.210

777
01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.680
1 minute left

778
01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.650

780
01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.410
57

781
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.050

782
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:01.730

783
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:03.140
no way

784
01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.140

785
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.860
what

786
01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.330
you said you love sweet potatoes right

787
01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:16.490
right

788
01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:18.100
right?

789
01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:18.760
right

790
01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:19.899
right

791
01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.819
right

792
01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.085
must be something wrong with you if you love that

793
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:30.010
what's wrong with everybody loving something different

794
01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:31.689
take it easy

795
01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:32.930
wrong

796
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.640
problem is right here

797
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.130
kind of makes sense

798
01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:37.840
what

799
01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.880
time is almost up

800
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.439
who is lying

801
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.340
what

802
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.340
it's you

803
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.920
let's just say you

804
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.040
no

805
01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.040
it's not me

806
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.500
I am truthful

807
01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:19.340
I love sweet potatoes

808
01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.000
this is what happens to liars

809
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.580
keep that in mind

810
01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.130
next question

811
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:49.819
I

812
01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.660
love takahata shun

813
01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:57.880
yes or no��

814
01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.220
no

815
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.220
no

816
01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.570
that's depressing...

817
01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.960
yes��

818
01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.500
what about the girls?

819
01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.770
we go back a long ways

820
01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:28.770
have been through a lot

821
01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.160
If I have to say it

822
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.680
yes��

823
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.410
well, why is it... feels like you're so reluctant ��

824
01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:54.260
I am also, yes

825
01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.980
very popular

826
01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.120
this kid

827
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.960
what do you think of yourself?

828
01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.880
me?

829
01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:32.530
no

830
01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:44.090
never liked myself

831
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.760
you guys

832
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:59.140
lying again

833
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.660
who was lying

834
01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.130
2 minutes left

835
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.770
2 minutes

836
01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.580
who is it

837
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.700
fucking stop it

838
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.700
maybe 

839
01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.080
you

840
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.460
you were trying to kills us 

841
01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.620
you said you like shun

842
01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.620
isn't that weird?

843
01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:43.420
to love andt to kill is the same thing is it not?

844
01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.460
takahata

845
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.250
aren't you the one lying

846
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:58.460
people who doesn't love themselves

847
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.300
probably don't exist

848
01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.560
say something

849
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:18.560
it is suspicious

850
01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:22.660
originally

851
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.700
if everybody answered truthfully, we can all survive

852
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:29.540
no need to lie at all

853
01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:33.700
who and why is this person lying?

854
01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.970
finally figured out what  the problem was?

855
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:40.970
that's because

856
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:46.020
we have friends amongst you guys

857
01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:50.180
pretending to be human

858
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.240
trying to kill all of you

859
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.210
therefore lying on purpose

860
01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.170
if you don't find this person soon

861
01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:02.420
everybody will die

862
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.080
that's annoying

863
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.400
the bad person who's lying

864
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.900
I love white

865
01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:19.040
amongst us

866
01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.120
someone is of of them

867
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:35.640
1 minute left

868
01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.200
59

869
01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.600
58

870
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:40.680
no more time

871
01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.220
wait a second

872
01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.250
both of us go to the same school

873
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:45.170
so?

874
01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.250
we've known each other for a while

875
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.620


876
01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:50.690
takahata��

877
01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:51.400
and ichika 

878
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.240
and amaya��

879
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.220
are all going to the same school and know each other

880
01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.280
in other words�說

881
01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.640
enemy among us is

882
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:05.890
no she..

883
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:07.890
that's right

884
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:11.200
you the only one who doesn't know anyone

885
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.170
no

886
01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:13.610
I didn't lie

887
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.820
we went to the same junior high

888
01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:18.040
she can't be the enemy

889
01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.120
that's even more strange

890
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.490
the chances of running into such a person

891
01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:21.090
what

892
01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:21.980
isn't that an obvious trap

893
01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:23.060
I trust Takese

894
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.060
don't be fooled by girls

895
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.920
15

896
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.900
14

897
01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.680
13

898
01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.000
if you don't hurry

899
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.860
when time is up, everybody dies

900
01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.770
who's the mole

901
01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:39.010
understand?

902
01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.660
10

903
01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.970
9

904
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.480
8

905
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.650
7

906
01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:46.040
6

907
01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.290
5

908
01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.290
it's her

909
01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.610
stop that

910
01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:53.610
stop

911
01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.850
stop

912
01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.740
I didn't lie

913
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.360
I

914
01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.640
really do love takahata

915
01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:09.560
please don't let go of my hand

916
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:27.570
what a pity

917
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:32.460
she's a human afterall

918
01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.050
then next question

919
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:05.010
wait one second

920
01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:08.200
why, it's going so well, don't interrupt

921
01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.520
I know

922
01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.640
who's lying

923
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.260
I know

924
01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.610
finally figured it out huh

925
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:37.220
who��

926
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.250
the real liar is

927
01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:01.410
it's you

928
01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:12.120
I saw that in the very beginning

929
01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.120
what do you mean

930
01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.570
this game has been rigged from the start

931
01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:24.290
saying there's a mole among us was also a lie

932
01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:27.140
takese

933
01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.680
takese's blood

934
01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.460
told me the truth

935
01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:51.820
you are no white bear

936
01:19:57.170 --> 01:20:00.240
you figured me out

937
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:06.960
takahata

938
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.040


939
01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:28.690
hot

940
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.400
so hot hot

941
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:35.080
too hot too hot

942
01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:51.260
like the rules said, by telling you the truth

943
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:55.500
you are no white bear

944
01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.720
you are a horrible

945
01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.080
horrible black demon bear

946
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.620
game over

947
01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.850
takahata shun

948
01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:20.560
amaya takeru ichika akimoto

949
01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:26.260
oku eiji maeda kotaro

950
01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.810
5 mentioned above

951
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:32.960
survie survive

952
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.020
stop running

953
01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.320
I wonder what's coming up

954
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.700
i'm guessing

955
01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.720
some game that starts with "ma"

956
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.970
ma

957
01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.580
what, you haven't noticed?

958
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.440
names of all of our previous games followed a word relay

959
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:26.440
word relay?

960
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.440
yes word relay

961
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:30.520
first of all, it's daruma

962
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.050
manekineko

963
01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.500
dolls kokeshi

964
01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:44.300
after that it was the bear shirokuma

965
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.580
really

966
01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.090
yes

967
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:55.460
so what's coming next has to be ma-something

968
01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.000
for example...

969
01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:24.180
matryoshka

970
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.740
you guys, managed to make it here

971
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.960
this is the last round

972
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:53.080
so let's have a good time together

973
01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:55.540
this the last

974
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.860
what are we to do

975
01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.300
finally this is it

976
01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:08.420
kick the can

977
01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.420
and it's over

978
01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:13.940
kick the can

979
01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.460
yes, rules are simple

980
01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:22.860
the demon starts by retrieving the can from the top of the castle

981
01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:27.060
put it in the designated spot

982
01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:32.050
meanwhile, everyone besides the demon hide

983
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.210
after the demon has placed the can

984
01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.900
he then will go look for the hidden ones

985
01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:44.240
if he finds someone, sees his face

986
01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.460
call out his name, stomp the can

987
01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.380
then the demon has caught a person

988
01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.780
ones that were caught

989
01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:56.420
are jailed right here in this cell

990
01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:59.320
if someone kicks the can

991
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.690
before he is caught

992
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:04.210
he can save whomever is in tha cell

993
01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:10.380
however, kicking will explode the can

994
01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:15.770
therefore the kicker can choose to save everybody

995
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:18.930
by sacrificing himself

996
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.780
very interesting right?

997
01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.600
when the game is over

998
01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.420
whoever isn't caught wins

999
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:33.450
on the other hand, if before the game ends

1000
01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:37.980
the demon is able to catch 3 people, demon wins

1001
01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.780
this kick the can game, someone will end up dying

1002
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.600
kick the can game of death right

1003
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.130
nah, it's having great fun while playing together

1004
01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:54.160
who's gonna be the demon then

1005
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.920
draw lots

1006
01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.140
one two

1007
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:13.810
I'm the demon

1008
01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:15.810
coincidentally...

1009
01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:17.810
the wrost possible person

1010
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:23.240
timer is until the sun sets

1011
01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.290
yeah

1012
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:31.320
game start

1013
01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320
let's go

1014
01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.940
start is the most important part

1015
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.340
while this guy is getting the can

1016
01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:40.520
we get as far as we can

1017
01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.880
ok

1018
01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.570
cool

1019
01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:10.120
we should be fine, we're quite a ways out

1020
01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:12.680
should be about an hour till the sunset

1021
01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.080
before that, if we don't move we won't be discovered

1022
01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.280
too easy

1023
01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:23.420
no, it's not gonna work

1024
01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:31.080
what was your name again?

1025
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:34.280
fuck

1026
01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:47.300
eh... what was it?
 

1027
01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:50.040
yes, I remember

1028
01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:54.700
Oku and Kotaro

1029
01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.160
got them

1030
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.920
something is not right with him

1031
01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.280
I think, He might  have seen me just now

1032
01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.200
alright

1033
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:27.890
alright good, hurry

1034
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.770
you go first

1035
01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:43.770
hey ichika ichika

1036
01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:57.000
akimoto ichika, found you

1037
01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.420
it's over

1038
01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:47.160
takahata is not gonna sacrifice himself to save us

1039
01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:54.250
no way he's gonna beat amaya

1040
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.410
fuck

1041
01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.100
when the sun sets

1042
01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.720
it's gonna be it for us

1043
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.330
what to do

1044
01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:10.860
what do I do

1045
01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:17.490
takahata, can you hear me

1046
01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:21.000
I have already caught 3 people

1047
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.680
I'm gonna live

1048
01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.050
so I don't have to come after you

1049
01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.260
you can come out

1050
01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.740
and we wait till sunset

1051
01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.420
the two of us will live on

1052
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.440
live on

1053
01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.210
we are chosen by god

1054
01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:47.200
we can live on in the new world

1055
01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.420
new world

1056
01:31:50.050 --> 01:31:54.440
you are also hoping for a world like this

1057
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:58.620
just like me

1058
01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.130
I

1059
01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.640
I...

1060
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.720
shun, can you hear me

1061
01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:17.130
honestly, I hate you

1062
01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.760
you have never had any drive, motivation, always blaming others

1063
01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:27.080
cancel plans last minute

1064
01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.090
you don't understand me at all

1065
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:39.060
so I never want to see you again

1066
01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.680
so...

1067
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:51.820
so whatever you do, don't come out

1068
01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.240
what this guy said

1069
01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.730
can't be trusted

1070
01:32:58.730 --> 01:33:02.940
get away from here

1071
01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:05.840
understand?

1072
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.760
ichika

1073
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:20.260
shun is nothing like you

1074
01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:25.180
shun is more caring and more powerful

1075
01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:27.960
nothing like you at all

1076
01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:07.490
takahata

1077
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:09.490
we are friends right?

1078
01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:12.040
game is about to end

1079
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.320
believe me, come out

1080
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:18.140
got it

1081
01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:20.720
I'm coming out now

1082
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:24.820
shun, don't be fooled

1083
01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.980
sorry to keep you waiting

1084
01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.980
amaya

1085
01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:07.650
the rule says you gotta see my face and call out my name

1086
01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:13.100
this way, you can't see my face

1087
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.100
that idiot

1088
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.720
what's he thinking

1089
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.730
indeed, his face can't be seen like this

1090
01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:25.460
and decent protection against the explosion

1091
01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:27.460
but

1092
01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:33.240
he can easily be caught and have the helmet removed

1093
01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.900
takahata, what are you doing?

1094
01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:45.960
come on, amaya

1095
01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.040
I will be your nemesis

1096
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:59.090
what's wrong

1097
01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:01.940
I thought you wanted to be my nemesis

1098
01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.650
shun, run

1099
01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:14.280
looks like wearing the armor is a pretty bad idea

1100
01:36:23.730 --> 01:36:28.260
takahata, found you

1101
01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:01.100
you were right amaya

1102
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:04.940
I have always been thinking

1103
01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:08.760
boring, meaningless world 

1104
01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.980
should be completely destroyed

1105
01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:16.090
I prayed for it half seriously

1106
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:20.960
but, it't not like that at all

1107
01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.500
only after loss do I understand appreciation

1108
01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.690
I am such an ididot

1109
01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:32.130
only faced with death do I understand the value of life

1110
01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:34.200
I'm such an idiot

1111
01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.060
people living their lives, taking everything for granted

1112
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:42.960
all the important things seem so trivial

1113
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:48.090
those boring days are the best 

1114
01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.520
sorry amaya

1115
01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.890
I'm not like you

1116
01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.170
worry not

1117
01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.410
I have never wanted to help you

1118
01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:13.370
no matter how hard you fight

1119
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:14.720
if I can stomp the can and say your name

1120
01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.300
you lose

1121
01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.980
is that so

1122
01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.660
wearing this clumsy armor, it's not to hide my face

1123
01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:26.770
nor to protect against the explosion

1124
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.740
it's for this

1125
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.340
shun

1126
01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.030
enough

1127
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:19.360
don't 

1128
01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.790
shun

1129
01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:30.510
satake and shouko

1130
01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.450
must have a lot of things they wanted to do in life

1131
01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.280
something about

1132
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:59.200
chosen by god?

1133
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:09.130
if god really created this world

1134
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:21.220
god or whatever, go to hell

1135
01:41:21.230 --> 01:41:24.880
shun, no

1136
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:29.210
takahata

1137
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:31.530
it's gonna go off

1138
01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:18.080
wha

1139
01:42:33.710 --> 01:42:35.450
over

1140
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:40.140
takahata shun has saved the prisoners

1141
01:42:40.530 --> 01:42:44.350
amaya takeru, you number of prisoners is 0

1142
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.270
therefore, you're out

1143
01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.330
ichika akimoto oku eiji

1144
01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.990

1146
01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:03.920
great

1147
01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:07.580
something I don't quite get

1148
01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:09.330
we survived

1149
01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:11.750
we won

1150
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:14.990
but why, where was the explosion?

1151
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.610
about that

1152
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.160
we lied

1153
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:20.660


1154
01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:23.790
that made things more fun right?

1155
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.360
you damn things, stop fucking around

1156
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:34.110
I was chosen by god

1157
01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:36.200
How can I die here?

1158
01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.880
eh, what are you talking about dying?

1159
01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:44.190
Didn't we say at the very beginning

1160
01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:47.180
everybody was to play together and have fun

1161
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:51.690
didn't say losers will die, haha

1162
01:43:58.580 --> 01:43:59.740
are you serious

1163
01:44:00.970 --> 01:44:01.740
in other words�說

1164
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:26.730
all is finished

1165
01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:24.330
everybody

1166
01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.750
making it to this point, you all did well

1167
01:44:31.110 --> 01:44:32.350
we did it

1168
01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.080
we really survived

1169
01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:36.150
that's fantastic

1170
01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:40.690
