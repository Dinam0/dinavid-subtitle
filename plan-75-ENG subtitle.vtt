00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.825
Senior surplus
draining the Japanese economy

2
00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:01.950
and have a bad effect

3
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.825
in the younger generation.

4
00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:11.200
Of course, the elderly do not want
be a curse in our life.

5
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.075
The Japanese have a history of sacrifice
long and proud

6
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.950
to benefit the country.

7
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.450
I pray for my brave act

8
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.700
will spark a discussion

9
00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:37.325
and future

10
00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:40.700
brighter

11
00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:45.075
for this nation...

12
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.700
<i>This is the "Music Forest",
hosted by Radio Japan.</i>

13
00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:18.450
<i>And now the news.</i>

14
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.950
<i>Today, the government imposed
Bill "Plan 75", grant of rights</i>

15
00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:30.450
<i>to aid death for all
citizens aged 75 years and over.</i>

16
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.075
<i>In the middle of a hate crime
against parents in that country,</i>

17
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.575
<i>the community is getting
demanded drastic action</i>

18
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.325
<i>to address critical issues
's elderly population .</i>

19
00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:49.075
<i>"Plan 75" caused controversy
since it was first proposed,</i>

20
00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:52.325
<i>but the bill was passed
despite protests.</i>

21
00:05:53.325 --> 00:05:57.325
<i>A solution that never existed before
for the dilemma of the elderly population in Japan</i>

22
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.700
<i>has captured the world's attention...</i>

23
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.075
Stop sighing.

24
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:39.075
Who am I?

25
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.700
keep going.

26
00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:43.075
Good grief.

27
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.825
I didn't even notice.

28
00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:49.223
- How do you feel?
- Not great.

29
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.950
Do an inspection.

30
00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:53.825
The doctor scared me.

31
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.325
I'll get this out.

32
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.575
Well.

33
00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:05.450
Those apples look so delicious!

34
00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:09.075
Thank you very much.

35
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.950
Oh, this one's a little crushed.

36
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.200
Same after you eat it.

37
00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:16.450
- That's right.
- Of course.

38
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.950
This is for you.

39
00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:24.950
Please, Ineko.

40
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.950
Enjoy your meal.

41
00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:30.075
I'll eat a piece too.

42
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.325
Enjoy your meal!

43
00:10:44.575 --> 00:10:45.348
Enjoy your meal.

44
00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:32.075
Is there any
got ticket number 5?

45
00:11:38.575 --> 00:11:40.700
Are you number 5 maybe?

46
00:11:46.825 --> 00:11:47.950
I'm number 5.

47
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.200
Sorry make you wait.
Get over here.

48
00:11:54.846 --> 00:11:56.596
My knees are a little...

49
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.200
Just wait there.

50
00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:08.456
It's too troublesome!

51
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.950
Just a little walk.

52
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.825
Let's use this.

53
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.075
- Thank you.
- This.

54
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.450
Thank you.

55
00:12:19.325 --> 00:12:20.950
What can you do?

56
00:12:25.075 --> 00:12:26.700
Can you lift your leg?

57
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.200
- This one too.
- Okay.

58
00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:35.575
Sorry make you wait.

59
00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:46.075
I see you have done
your homework.

60
00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:47.950
I have many questions.

61
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.200
We received 1000 Dollars
" preparation fund ", right?

62
00:12:54.325 --> 00:12:54.825
Right.

63
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.450
What can we use it for?

64
00:12:56.616 --> 00:13:00.825
Good question. That's basically it
can be used for any purpose.

65
00:13:01.075 --> 00:13:05.825
For traveling, or enjoying eating in
outside. However you like it, really.

66
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.575
Like a gift.

67
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.825
Some registrars use it
for funeral expenses.

68
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.950
That's kinda normal!

69
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.950
And another question...

70
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.575
Yes.

71
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.575
The "group plan"...

72
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.075
What's that?

73
00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:28.450
This is one of those packages
offered for cremation and burial.

74
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.075
Registrants under the group plan
cremated and buried together.

75
00:13:33.575 --> 00:13:36.075
This service is completely free.

76
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.950
- No fees at all.
- That's right.

77
00:13:39.575 --> 00:13:44.825
The $1,000 fund I mentioned
really yours to use.

78
00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:49.950
Once I die, it makes no difference.

79
00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:53.575
Buried with others
no problem, right?

80
00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:57.241
Some registrars feel
not so lonely as that.

81
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.700
Is... difficult to
pass filter?

82
00:14:01.075 --> 00:14:03.325
No process
special filter.

83
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.568
No inspection
health and unnecessary

84
00:14:05.592 --> 00:14:08.491
doctor's approval
or your family.

85
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.950
So far, this is the easiest way.

86
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.450
I agree.

87
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.825
The simpler the better.

88
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.950
- Did you register today?
- Yes.

89
00:14:22.325 --> 00:14:25.075
Well.
I'll clean up the paperwork.

90
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.325
Exactly 30 minutes.

91
00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:30.825
On time.

92
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.825
Tea for you.

93
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.450
This.

94
00:15:03.325 --> 00:15:04.700
Enjoy your tea.

95
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.075
Bring your elbows forward.

96
00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:16.950
And up, and turn
your elbows back.

97
00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:20.450
Once again...

98
00:15:22.075 --> 00:15:24.575
I will lift your feet now.

99
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.700
Okay.

100
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.575
It's cold today, isn't it?

101
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.450
feels good.

102
00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.950
Please wait a moment.

103
00:16:01.325 --> 00:16:03.074
- Hello.
- Hello.

104
00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:04.950
May I do
body check?

105
00:16:13.825 --> 00:16:15.450
Please raise your hand.

106
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.825
Hi darling. How are you?

107
00:16:59.575 --> 00:17:01.116
Mom really miss you.

108
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:03.866
How do you feel?

109
00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:09.950
They gave you another injection?

110
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.700
That's right, I said it doesn't hurt.

111
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.575
You are a brave girl.

112
00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:26.740
Your game will arrive soon.

113
00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:31.490
Just be patient a little more, okay?

114
00:17:34.866 --> 00:17:37.575
I'm lucky you are
good girl.

115
00:17:41.575 --> 00:17:43.241
Is dad there?

116
00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:46.741
Can I talk to him?

117
00:17:54.825 --> 00:17:57.018
How are you, honey?

118
00:18:04.075 --> 00:18:07.241
Doctor says
does he need surgery urgently?

119
00:18:11.116 --> 00:18:12.491
Isn't it too early?

120
00:18:16.991 --> 00:18:18.991
What is the success rate?

121
00:18:47.825 --> 00:18:51.950
<i>Number 40 to 50, please
to the examination room.</i>

122
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.700
This?

123
00:18:54.325 --> 00:18:56.825
Button above.
The one that says "start".

124
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.950
This one.

125
00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:00.825
Can.

126
00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:07.700
Difficult to lift
your head in a place like this.

127
00:19:08.575 --> 00:19:10.700
Looks like we're holding on tight
on life.

128
00:19:11.075 --> 00:19:11.950
Right.

129
00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:20.700
<i>This announcement is for the patient
examination of the elderly group .</i>

130
00:19:21.075 --> 00:19:25.200
<i>Patients receiving cancer screening,
please proceed to the second floor</i>

131
00:19:25.575 --> 00:19:27.700
<i>after filling
questionnaire .</i>

132
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.700
<i>"For our bright future..."</i>

133
00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:41.950
<i>Humans have no choice
whether to be born,</i>

134
00:19:43.075 --> 00:19:48.680
<i>but how good
if we could choose</i>

135
00:19:49.325 --> 00:19:50.825
<i>when it's time to die.</i>

136
00:19:51.075 --> 00:19:56.450
<i>Can decide how
my life will end</i>

137
00:19:57.325 --> 00:19:59.450
<i>give me peace of mind.</i>

138
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.825
<i>Without a feeling of doubt.</i>

139
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.418
<i>"He lived a good life
by decision,"</i>

140
00:20:04.442 --> 00:20:07.575
<i>is what people
will say about me.</i>

141
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:17.700
<i>Package 75 available free for all

<i>Plan 75.</i>

146
00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:52.575
Excuse me.

147
00:20:53.075 --> 00:20:55.450
We have a reservation
for four people at one o'clock.

148
00:20:56.325 --> 00:20:58.950
- Please come in.
- Fill it for us.

149
00:21:14.325 --> 00:21:15.450
78 years.

150
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.325
What's the time now?

151
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.075
It's just one o'clock.

152
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.450
Let's go.

153
00:21:22.075 --> 00:21:25.325
"Tangled Hair". Number 25.

154
00:21:28.325 --> 00:21:29.200
25...

155
00:21:29.825 --> 00:21:32.950
Who's first today?
How about you Michi?

156
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.450
I can go later.

157
00:21:34.575 --> 00:21:39.325
Go ahead sometime.
Sanae and I always sing.

158
00:21:39.575 --> 00:21:41.450
"Sake of Sorrow".

159
00:21:42.825 --> 00:21:43.450
What number?

160
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.825
37.

161
00:21:52.075 --> 00:21:56.825
"Under the shade of an old apple tree"

162
00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:02.825
"Tomorrow we will
meet one more time"

163
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.575
"When the sun goes red"

164
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.950
"Sink in the west"

165
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.075
"Cheek to cheek fun"

166
00:22:19.825 --> 00:22:24.700
"With a whisper of love"

167
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.700
"Love burns in crimson"

168
00:22:31.075 --> 00:22:36.200
"Like an apple, oh so red"

169
00:22:44.575 --> 00:22:45.575
Look.

170
00:22:47.653 --> 00:22:49.975
It's like a resort hotel.

171
00:22:51.325 --> 00:22:52.700
I took some pamphlets.

172
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.450
One for you.

173
00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:57.825
This.

174
00:23:02.075 --> 00:23:03.450
It's very expensive.

175
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.457
This is Plan 75 "Platinum".

176
00:23:05.482 --> 00:23:06.847
They have everything.

177
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.700
Swimming pool, hot spring,
even a beauty salon. And massage.

178
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.825
And a photo studio.

179
00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:18.825
They do your makeup and...
take beautiful portrait photos.

180
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.200
Like a keepsake photo.

181
00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:23.075
Could be a family photo too.

182
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:28.450
They called it the "breakup photo".

183
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.325
Private facilities are ball games
different. Makes sense.

184
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.075
I told you so.

185
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.325
Nonetheless, I
prefer to die at home.

186
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.075
I used to feel the same way.

187
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.950
But just look at this place.

188
00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.825
You will change your mind.

189
00:23:47.825 --> 00:23:49.700
With family around you,

190
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.950
and left with a smile
on your face will be amazing.

191
00:23:53.575 --> 00:23:54.950
Are you ready to start?

192
00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.825
That day will come for all of us.

193
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:05.825
It's something I should think about
to do for my grandchildren.

194
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.075
If it's for my grandson,
i will do it too.

195
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:13.200
Hi. You should go on a tour.

196
00:24:13.825 --> 00:24:15.450
Is it really free?

197
00:24:17.075 --> 00:24:19.575
one night two days
meal included.

198
00:24:20.825 --> 00:24:21.825
What kind of food?

199
00:24:22.075 --> 00:24:24.325
Super fancy menus.

200
00:24:34.325 --> 00:24:35.075
How about this?

201
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.450
You like this, right?

202
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.575
- Especially?
- It's too greasy.

203
00:24:42.825 --> 00:24:44.575
- That looks good.
- Hijiki.

204
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.200
You want mackerel?

205
00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:50.950
Should we splurge?

206
00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:55.575
All in all 19.23 Dollars.

207
00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:57.200
I'm the treat.

208
00:24:57.325 --> 00:24:59.574
Oh, they shouldn't!
You are the guest.

209
00:24:59.575 --> 00:25:01.325
I'm the one who forced it.

210
00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:03.324
- This.
- Thank you.

211
00:25:03.325 --> 00:25:05.950
So, I'm with
happy to receive it.

212
00:25:10.825 --> 00:25:14.325
Ineko? do you have
towels to dry off?

213
00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:16.700
Leave it.

214
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.575
It will dry too.

215
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:19.616
Are you sure?

216
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.450
Sit down and drink tea.

217
00:25:24.575 --> 00:25:27.825
I'll skip
my last bus home.

218
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.200
Just stay here.

219
00:25:30.825 --> 00:25:32.700
I have many futons.

220
00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:39.200
Brush your teeth.

221
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.450
I have prepared everything
what you need. Pajamas too.

222
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:46.825
In that case, okay.

223
00:25:47.325 --> 00:25:48.258
stay the night.

224
00:25:56.825 --> 00:26:00.950
You never heard
news from your daughter?

225
00:26:02.325 --> 00:26:04.700
I've never met
with my grandchildren.

226
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:09.075
Even with the kids, I'm lonely.

227
00:26:10.825 --> 00:26:13.325
We are all alone in life.

228
00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:16.450
So true.

229
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.575
Must be too bright.

230
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.825
I'm fine.

231
00:26:31.825 --> 00:26:35.075
Well, I have bodyguards tonight.

232
00:26:35.825 --> 00:26:37.575
A thief wouldn't dare enter.

233
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.950
Someone can definitely sleep here.

234
00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:26.325
I have brought some backups
higher. Please have a look.

235
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.200
Give me that one.

236
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.825
This is our highest model.

237
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.325
It's so high.

238
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.325
- Very high.
- This hurts.

239
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.450
Some people sleep downstairs.

240
00:27:44.575 --> 00:27:46.450
- Under the crack?
- Yes.

241
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:50.916
It's about that height
same but different material.

242
00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:54.396
- Cold.
- Made of iron.

243
00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:58.008
This one hurts.

244
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.825
Yes, it hurts.

245
00:28:01.825 --> 00:28:03.950
This version is slightly different.

246
00:28:05.575 --> 00:28:06.325
Congested.

247
00:28:06.575 --> 00:28:07.825
There is this type too?

248
00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:13.075
Kids won't get stuck
in it, so it might be safer.

249
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.825
- I'm sliding down.
- This is the shape.

250
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200
This is good.

251
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:25.700
That explains the plan.
Do you have any questions?

252
00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:27.075
- Not.
- Very nice.

253
00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:32.450
Here is the application form.
Please fill in.

254
00:28:36.075 --> 00:28:37.200
Thank you very much.

255
00:28:44.325 --> 00:28:45.200
Good night.

256
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.825
Thank you.

257
00:31:03.543 --> 00:31:04.856
Brothers and Sisters.

258
00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:09.325
Brothers and Sisters!

259
00:31:12.075 --> 00:31:13.700
I want to say something.

260
00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:19.075
Before we eat, can we
everyone listen to me?

261
00:31:20.325 --> 00:31:23.450
Maria worked as a governess here.

262
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.450
He helps senior citizens.

263
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.825
Now, he needs our help.

264
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:36.700
Because he is
going through hard times.

265
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.450
Would you like to explain yourself?

266
00:31:45.241 --> 00:31:46.075
Hi everybody.

267
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.200
This is my daughter in the Philippines.

268
00:31:51.396 --> 00:31:55.266
He was only five years old however
he was born with a heart condition.

269
00:31:56.825 --> 00:32:00.700
Now he needs surgery.

270
00:32:02.741 --> 00:32:03.741
What's his name?

271
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.912
Ruby.

272
00:32:07.366 --> 00:32:09.116
What a beautiful child.

273
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.825
Her name is Ruby.
Isn't she a pretty girl?

274
00:32:18.616 --> 00:32:22.089
Now we will
distributing donation boxes.

275
00:32:22.488 --> 00:32:28.691
Let's all show
our spirit of love and charity

276
00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:31.616
to Maria and Ruby.

277
00:32:38.146 --> 00:32:39.324
I appreciate it.

278
00:32:39.325 --> 00:32:41.950
You can get past this.
Rest assured.

279
00:32:43.575 --> 00:32:46.116
I told you they would help.

280
00:32:47.575 --> 00:32:49.825
Thank you very much.

281
00:32:59.616 --> 00:33:00.950
How much do you earn?

282
00:33:01.366 --> 00:33:03.575
About 1500 Dollars a month.

283
00:33:03.825 --> 00:33:04.616
Please sit.

284
00:33:05.825 --> 00:33:09.200
I know work
who pay more.

285
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.325
What kind of job?

286
00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:15.116
With senior citizens.

287
00:33:15.616 --> 00:33:19.575
But I don't know the details yet.

288
00:33:20.075 --> 00:33:23.241
But I know them
pay well.

289
00:33:23.616 --> 00:33:24.700
How could that be?

290
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:30.325
Maybe due to the government.

291
00:33:31.991 --> 00:33:34.116
Can I have your cell number?

292
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.116
Of course!

293
00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.450
Excuse me.

294
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:10.324
Uncle.

295
00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:12.949
Yes?

296
00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:16.449
I'm Hiromu.

297
00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:21.574
Takeo's son?

298
00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:23.074
Yes.

299
00:34:26.824 --> 00:34:28.074
You've grown.

300
00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:30.574
Been a long time.

301
00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.699
This is my request.

302
00:35:06.075 --> 00:35:06.700
What?

303
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.700
It's his birthday.

304
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.200
He is 75 years old today.

305
00:35:19.325 --> 00:35:20.075
So he has...

306
00:35:20.825 --> 00:35:22.200
That's a good spirit.

307
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.450
are you close to him?

308
00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:28.423
Not. Never met
with him for 20 years.

309
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.950
He didn't even come
to my father's funeral.

310
00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.825
Every family has one like that.

311
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.075
Yes.

312
00:35:37.075 --> 00:35:38.325
are you ok with that?

313
00:35:43.825 --> 00:35:45.450
- Yes...
- Meet.

314
00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:49.950
Aunt and uncle are
within three degrees...

315
00:35:51.325 --> 00:35:52.700
You can't do this one.

316
00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:57.541
All right, I will
handed it to Sakurai.

317
00:35:58.575 --> 00:35:59.700
Yes. Do it.

318
00:36:07.241 --> 00:36:11.594
- Thanks for all your teaching.
- No problem. Thank you.

319
00:36:12.093 --> 00:36:14.178
Thank you for
Mrs. Kakutani's service.

320
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.075
- I thank you for everything.
- And my thanks to you.

321
00:36:19.075 --> 00:36:21.281
Thank you for
Mrs. Mimura's service.

322
00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:24.825
- Please take care of yourself.
- Sure, thank you.

323
00:36:33.575 --> 00:36:35.095
Can you hold this for me?

324
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:45.523
So tacky. Who is
would choose a color like this?

325
00:36:46.707 --> 00:36:49.582
So are you going to your son?

326
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.575
Still not sure.

327
00:36:52.075 --> 00:36:54.450
Lives with his wife
can be annoying, huh?

328
00:36:55.232 --> 00:36:57.357
Living alone is much easier.

329
00:36:58.575 --> 00:36:59.700
How about you?

330
00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:06.950
My eldest daughter said she would
paid me to raise his child.

331
00:37:07.206 --> 00:37:09.081
Don't want to do it.

332
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.180
No omelet
without breaking the egg.

333
00:37:12.575 --> 00:37:13.575
How about you Michi?

334
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.994
As you know, I don't have any
nobody. I have to find a job.

335
00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:23.041
Ineko came out
hospital today, right?

336
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:27.950
I hope he doesn't faint
at workplace.

337
00:37:28.825 --> 00:37:31.200
None at home
who can help him.

338
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.700
Yes, but why should we suffer?

339
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.075
- There is a written complaint.
- About what?

340
00:37:40.075 --> 00:37:42.700
Too bad the hotel
forcing seniors to work.

341
00:37:42.825 --> 00:37:44.450
Lots of lies.

342
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.825
The company just says it is.

343
00:37:48.825 --> 00:37:51.825
If an elderly employee dies on the spot
work, it will damage their image.

344
00:37:52.325 --> 00:37:55.075
Everyone will grow old...

345
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.325
Thank you.

346
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.825

Ineko?

This is Michi.

351
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:12.575
Maybe you're sleeping.

352
00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:16.038
Hello?

353
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.950
I'm just calling for
know how you are.

354
00:39:28.825 --> 00:39:30.165
I will call again.

355
00:39:31.575 --> 00:39:32.700
Look after yourself.

356
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.075
Hello. This is Wakabayashi.

357
00:39:45.325 --> 00:39:46.575
You got a minute?

358
00:39:48.075 --> 00:39:51.346
I wonder if
you can help me.

359
00:39:52.825 --> 00:39:57.730
I have a female customer
78 years old. Not working.

360
00:39:59.325 --> 00:40:00.450
Single occupant.

361
00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:05.155
I know. Yes...

362
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:11.065
Is there a way you can accommodate him?
We're the fifth place he's placed.

363
00:40:13.075 --> 00:40:13.700
Right.

364
00:40:15.075 --> 00:40:16.015
I understand.

365
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.825
A moment.

366
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:26.221
If you can pay two years in advance,
he will rent out to the elderly.

367
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.146
Hello? It will be difficult...

368
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.200
That's right.

369
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:37.518
I understand.

370
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.575
No problem.
We'll talk again. Thank you.

371
00:40:42.075 --> 00:40:43.575
Unfortunately the answer is no.

372
00:40:43.825 --> 00:40:47.075
If I can't get a job,
I guess there's little chance.

373
00:40:47.153 --> 00:40:48.903
This is generally difficult.

374
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.614
By the way, have you
considering well-being?

375
00:40:55.825 --> 00:41:00.413
There are properties for less fortunate people.
Maybe a better chance.

376
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.700
I'm not ready for that choice.

377
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.950
Oh I see.

378
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.825
So I'm afraid we don't
can help you. Forgive me.

379
00:41:17.325 --> 00:41:18.200
Sorry.

380
00:41:22.325 --> 00:41:24.038
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

381
00:41:27.991 --> 00:41:29.825
78 years...

382
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.450
Then...

383
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.075
Finished.

384
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.700
Again?

385
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:58.825
Excuse me?

386
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.950
Yes?

387
00:42:00.173 --> 00:42:03.548
I don't think this is working.
I keep getting zero results.

388
00:42:10.001 --> 00:42:11.626
It works fine.

389
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:13.656
Miss Oshima?

390
00:42:14.706 --> 00:42:15.316
Yes?

391
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:21.916
Then what's the problem?

392
00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.825
We can't offer
anything to you.

393
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.075
Sorry.

394
00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.450
It really failed.

395
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.575
It's because of my age, they say.

396
00:43:08.075 --> 00:43:11.450
So, the reason I called...

397
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.075
Remember you said
about babysitting your grandson?

398
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.325
I wanted to ask if
I can do it.

399
00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:21.450
Yes, me.

400
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:29.950
Oh I see.

401
00:43:32.075 --> 00:43:34.200
Or maybe your daughter's friend.

402
00:43:35.075 --> 00:43:36.325
Oh, of course!

403
00:43:38.075 --> 00:43:40.641
Sorry to call at dinner.

404
00:43:41.325 --> 00:43:42.950
Okay, I'll hang up.

405
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.950
See you then.

406
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:49.200
This is a special unit
for people without families.

407
00:45:51.116 --> 00:45:55.700
We take care of the cremation
for them. Together.

408
00:45:58.806 --> 00:46:03.890
First, two people work
same for one patient.

409
00:46:04.575 --> 00:46:07.450
Don't chat.
That's manners. Okay?

410
00:46:47.575 --> 00:46:49.116
How's the trip?

411
00:46:49.491 --> 00:46:50.950
Fluent.

412
00:46:51.116 --> 00:46:53.825
When the girls were little,

413
00:46:55.325 --> 00:47:01.700
I'll ride with one kid in front,
one in the back, and the baby is tied.

414
00:47:02.575 --> 00:47:05.226
Those three kids?
Isn't that difficult?

415
00:47:05.325 --> 00:47:10.616
Well, I'm tough. Just kidding.
You know, we moms

416
00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:13.666
draw strength from our children.

417
00:47:14.616 --> 00:47:15.450
Of course.

418
00:47:15.475 --> 00:47:20.079
Even if the road is uphill,
you will be able to do it.

419
00:47:20.575 --> 00:47:22.738
- You're going to slide up.
- Is that true?

420
00:47:23.491 --> 00:47:28.616
By the way, you
can let go of these two chairs.

421
00:47:32.437 --> 00:47:33.478
You want to go up?

422
00:47:33.968 --> 00:47:35.009
I want to go up!

423
00:47:37.759 --> 00:47:40.884
- Wait a moment. Is it okay?
- Of course.

424
00:47:43.028 --> 00:47:44.688
This one's heavy.

425
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.825
<i>No one can accept
your current phone call .</i>

426
00:52:36.075 --> 00:52:36.950
What's this?

427
00:52:38.325 --> 00:52:39.688
Oh, blood donation records.

428
00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:50.575
Have you ever been in Nagasaki?

429
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.325
Nagasaki?

430
00:52:54.325 --> 00:52:56.038
Oh, for the bridge.

431
00:52:56.825 --> 00:52:57.575
Bridge?

432
00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:01.450
Tunnels, highways, dams...
I will build anything.

433
00:53:01.825 --> 00:53:03.119
- You did it?
- Yes.

434
00:53:03.825 --> 00:53:06.560
All over Japan.
No attachment.

435
00:53:10.825 --> 00:53:12.218
Hiroshima...

436
00:53:12.575 --> 00:53:13.825
Sendai...

437
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:18.863
Nagoya.

438
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:20.575
Hokkaido!

439
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.075
That's a lot of blood.

440
00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:24.248
That's right.

441
00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:31.950
Now plastic.

442
00:53:35.179 --> 00:53:37.140
- Kinda bland.
- Yes, right?

443
00:53:40.075 --> 00:53:42.075
- Throw them away?
- Yes.

444
00:53:54.825 --> 00:53:56.075
You keep it there?

445
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:57.751
They stay cold.

446
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.553
How's your mother?

447
00:54:14.575 --> 00:54:15.450
He remarried.

448
00:54:18.825 --> 00:54:19.575
When?

449
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.825
When is it?

450
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:23.950
It's been a long time.

451
00:54:24.575 --> 00:54:26.200
Before your father died?

452
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:34.950
Father is very mellowed out
after he got sick.

453
00:54:35.325 --> 00:54:36.575
He used to be really tough.

454
00:54:50.606 --> 00:54:51.481
There is only one.

455
00:54:51.873 --> 00:54:53.450
I will eat from the pot.

456
00:54:54.164 --> 00:54:56.414
<i>It's been three years since

457

Thank you very much.

468
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:56.200
Good night.

469
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:23.450
Would you like some soup?

470
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:36.325
Thank you.

471
01:00:18.825 --> 01:00:19.575
Hello?

472
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:24.075
<i>Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

473

<i>This is Yoko Narimiya

<i>Do I speak
with Mrs. Michi Kakutani?</i>

475
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.081
Yes that's correct.

476
01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:37.950
<i>Thank you for signing up
to Plan 75.</i>

477

You.

485
01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:25.741
I? No, thank you.

486
01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:32.267
Dead people, useless anymore.

487
01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:35.325
You're useful, no trash.

488
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:36.866
Everyone is good.

489
01:02:46.491 --> 01:02:47.575
Remember...

490
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:49.700
the dead.

491
01:02:58.825 --> 01:03:01.450
My first marriage, I was arranged.

492
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.075
I can't refuse.

493
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:10.825
Family run business. I
ordered from morning to night.

494
01:03:11.825 --> 01:03:13.825
It becomes a tough task.

495
01:03:15.711 --> 01:03:18.478
What I think about every day
is running away.

496
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.450
<i>Are you running away?</i>

497
01:03:25.825 --> 01:03:27.465
I have children.

498
01:03:29.575 --> 01:03:30.198
But...

499
01:03:32.825 --> 01:03:36.700
umbilical cord wrapped around
neck and died.

500
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:44.450
Small hospital can not do anything for
help such newborns.

501
01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.510
Is my 15 minutes up?

502
01:03:50.231 --> 01:03:52.831
Time flies when I
talk to you.

503
01:03:53.325 --> 01:03:55.700
<i>I'll call you
again on Friday.</i>

504
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:59.575
Friday. I'm looking forward to it.

505
01:04:00.325 --> 01:04:01.325
<i>Sleep well.</i>

506
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.873
Good night.

507
01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.825
<i>Hmm, hello?</i>

508
01:04:12.325 --> 01:04:13.075
Yes ma'am?

509
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.001
<i> Yes?</i>

510
01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.200
I'd like to ask.

511
01:04:36.825 --> 01:04:39.450
- This.
- Thank you.

512
01:04:54.075 --> 01:04:55.950
Sorry I forced it like this.

513
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.575
It's okay, if no one knows.

514
01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.700
Why are we not allowed
to meet?

515
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:07.450
Maybe so that people are not tied down
emotional and reconsidering.

516
01:05:10.542 --> 01:05:12.721
You're different than on the phone.

517
01:05:13.825 --> 01:05:17.751
- Are you disappointed?
- Not! Thank you for coming.

518
01:05:19.575 --> 01:05:21.700
Oh, before I forget.

519
01:05:23.575 --> 01:05:24.699
No ican't.

520
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.575
Help. To spend
time with me.

521
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.807
I received 1,000 Dollars, right? But
nowhere to use it.

522
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.325
I have no grandchildren.

523
01:05:34.825 --> 01:05:35.531
Take it.

524
01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:40.343
Thank you...

525
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:49.325
You make an impression
the same as your voice.

526
01:05:49.575 --> 01:05:50.200
Really?

527
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.586
I always thought you
have a good sound.

528
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.600
My second husband compliments my voice
when you first met me.

529
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.700
I'm pleased to hear it.

530
01:06:10.784 --> 01:06:13.284
Are you and your husband
come here often?

531
01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.200
I don't think
will change this much.

532
01:06:20.325 --> 01:06:21.700
This hasn't changed one bit.

533
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.575
Melon soda.

534
01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.825
"Cream Soda".

535
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:31.316
Looks delicious.

536
01:06:42.825 --> 01:06:45.450
- Want to try it?
- I?

537
01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.200
- Can you hold it?
- Yes.

538
01:06:53.325 --> 01:06:54.200
Like this?

539
01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:55.575
With both hands.

540
01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:00.450
You start there.

541
01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.575
And now?

542
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.700
Take three steps and throw.

543
01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:07.325
One two three...

544
01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:18.075
Almost.

545
01:07:21.325 --> 01:07:22.200
Once again?

546
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.200
OK, I'll try.

547
01:07:34.075 --> 01:07:35.325
- Right in the middle.
- Yes.

548
01:07:46.825 --> 01:07:47.825
